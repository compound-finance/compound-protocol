= ERC 20

[.readme-notice]
NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/erc20

This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC20 Token Standard].

TIP: For an overview of ERC20 tokens and a walk through on how to create a token contract read our xref:ROOT:erc20.adoc[ERC20 guide].

There are a few core contracts that implement the behavior specified in the EIP:

* {IERC20}: the interface all ERC20 implementations should conform to.
* {IERC20Metadata}: the extended ERC20 interface including the <<ERC20-name,`name`>>, <<ERC20-symbol,`symbol`>> and <<ERC20-decimals,`decimals`>> functions.
* {ERC20}: the implementation of the ERC20 interface, including the <<ERC20-name,`name`>>, <<ERC20-symbol,`symbol`>> and <<ERC20-decimals,`decimals`>> optional standard extension to the base interface.

Additionally there are multiple custom extensions, including:

* {ERC20Burnable}: destruction of own tokens.
* {ERC20Capped}: enforcement of a cap to the total supply when minting tokens.
* {ERC20Pausable}: ability to pause token transfers.
* {ERC20Snapshot}: efficient storage of past token balances to be later queried at any point in time.
* {ERC20Permit}: gasless approval of tokens (standardized as ERC2612).
* {ERC20FlashMint}: token level support for flash loans through the minting and burning of ephemeral tokens (standardized as ERC3156).
* {ERC20Votes}: support for voting and vote delegation.
* {ERC20VotesComp}: support for voting and vote delegation (compatible with Compound's token, with uint96 restrictions).
* {ERC20Wrapper}: wrapper to create an ERC20 backed by another ERC20, with deposit and withdraw methods. Useful in conjunction with {ERC20Votes}.
* {ERC4626}: tokenized vault that manages shares (represented as ERC20) that are backed by assets (another ERC20).

Finally, there are some utilities to interact with ERC20 contracts in various ways.

* {SafeERC20}: a wrapper around the interface that eliminates the need to handle boolean return values.
* {TokenTimelock}: hold tokens for a beneficiary until a specified time.

NOTE: This core set of contracts is designed to be unopinionated, allowing developers to access the internal functions in ERC20 (such as <<ERC20-_mint-address-uint256-,`_mint`>>) and expose them as external functions in the way they prefer. On the other hand, xref:ROOT:erc20.adoc#Presets[ERC20 Presets] (such as {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}) are designed using opinionated patterns to provide developers with ready to use, deployable contracts.
