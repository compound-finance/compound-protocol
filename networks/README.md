## Network Configuration

This folder contains the configuration for given networks (e.g. `rinkeby.json` is the configuration for the Rinkeby test-net). These configuration files are meant to be used to configure external applications (like dApps) and thus contain a base set of information that may be useful (such as the address the Controller and a list of vToken markets). These configuration files are auto-generated when doing local development.
